# Surfs Up!

## Overview

In this module we were tasked with determining the feasibility of a year round surf and ice cream shop located in Oahu, Hawaii. We partnered with the legendary surfer “W. Avy” and 
provided him with statistical analysis between different weather stations in the area across months to determine if the business model was sustainable. After using SQLite to 
analyze the data, we sent the results to our partner using Flask to report our findings.

## Results

- The first conclusion drawn from the analysis is that the mean temperature between the two months remains relatively consistent, with roughly a 4 degree change between them. This 
  is a good sign for our surf shop, as a relatively consistent temperature can ensure good surfing all year long.

- The second conclusion that stands out is the lowest recorded temperature for each month. There is quite a large difference between June (64°) and December (56°). Although the 
  average temperatures between the two are relatively consistent, we can expect a few more slower days in the month of December as it gets a bit chillier. This may provide us with 
  an opportunity to also offer additional products like wetsuit rentals however.
  
- The last conclusion from the dataset is the standard deviation for the month of December is a bit higher than June’s, meaning that our temperatures for that month will be a 
  little more dispersed from the mean. We can expect larger temperature fluctuations for that month, which may impact foot traffic into the shop.
  
## Summary

In summary, I believe that Oahu would be a prime candidate for the flagship surf and ice cream shop. Although in the month of December we may see a few slower days, and larger 
fluctuations in the temperature outside, on average it is comparable to June, meaning we can surf all year round. Further inquiries into tidal patterns for the year, as well as 
average rainfall may be beneficial to us before we fully commit to opening the shop to better determine surf conditions. Additionally, although not weather related, I would advise 
to look at incoming tourist patterns, as what may be cold to a local is surely not so bad for a tourist from say Wisconsin, who really wants to hit the waves.
